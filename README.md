## 📝 Next.js Admin Dashboard
Welcome to the Next.js Admin Dashboard, an application I built as part of the Next.js Dashboard App course. This dashboard allows users 
to manage customers and invoices, integrating key concepts like server-side rendering, data fetching, authentication, and more.

## 🚀 What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience in developing a comprehensive, full-stack dashboard with Next.js. Here’s a summary of the key topics covered:

## 📂 1. File-Based Routing
I learned how to build pages using Next.js’s intuitive file-based routing system. Each file in the /app directory became a page or API route, making navigation and API creation seamless.

## ⚙️ 2. Data Fetching with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Generation (SSG)
Explored both static generation and server-side rendering techniques. I used getStaticProps for pre-rendering pages at build time and getServerSideProps to fetch data at runtime when needed.

## 📑 3. Managing State and Actions
Using React Hooks like useActionState, I managed complex states in forms and performed server-side validation with libraries like Zod.
Created CRUD operations to handle customer and invoice data, making the dashboard fully functional.

## 🔐 4. Authentication and Authorization
Integrated NextAuth.js for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users could access certain parts of the dashboard (e.g., managing invoices and customer records).

## 🎨 5. Styling with Tailwind CSS
Designed a responsive, modern UI using Tailwind CSS. I learned how to apply utility-first classes for styling various components including buttons, forms, tables, and the dashboard layout.

## 📝 6. Form Validation & Accessibility
Implemented server-side validation using Zod and displayed error messages dynamically when forms failed.
Added ARIA labels to improve accessibility, ensuring that the dashboard is user-friendly for people using screen readers.

## 🔄 7. API Routes and Database Integration
Built API routes in Next.js to handle customer and invoice creation, updates, and deletion. These routes connect to a Postgres database hosted on Vercel.

## 📊 8. Deployment to Vercel
Finally, I deployed the application to Vercel, leveraging its seamless integration with Next.js for hosting and auto-deployments.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Next.js (15.0.0-canary.56)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Zod (for validation)
NextAuth.js (for authentication)
Postgres (for database)
Vercel (for deployment)
